  Sadly this page is a brief explanation into why I am not convinced that python is a great language, like the majority of my fellow students like to believe. The loading of libraries was a nightmare and I spent more time dealing with them than I did writing code.
</p>

<p>
  There will be a few requirements to get this code working on your system. First you will need Python 2.7. I also used pygame and a backport of lzma (which is part of Python 3.4, but is incompatible with the rest of the libraries). The pyevolve library is preinstalled with the code in my project.
</p>

<p>
  I will also have to give credit to Michael0x2a on StackExchange, for giving me the initial understanding of a direction to go with his project <a class="anchor" href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/15304/generating-a-1d-cellular-automata-in-python" aria-hidden="true">Generating a 1D cellular automata in Python</a>, because I had no idea where to start with Python and this kicked me into gear.
